"DC001"|9|"ESB"|"Escarpment, bedrock"|A relatively continuous and steep slope or cliff, which generally is produced by erosion but can be produced by faulting, that breaks the general continuity of more gently sloping land surfaces. Exposed earthy material is hard or soft bedrock.|"260243"
"DC001"|9|"ESO"|"Escarpment, nonbedrock"|A relatively continuous and steep slope or cliff, which generally is produced by erosion but can be produced by faulting, that breaks the continuity of more gently sloping land surfaces. Exposed earthy material is non soil or very shallow soil.|"260244"
"DC001"|9|"GPI"|"Gravel pit"|An open excavation from which soil and underlying material have been removed and used, without crushing, as a source of sand or gravel. Typically less than 1 acre.|"260245"
"DC001"|9|"GRA"|"Gravelly spot"|A spot where the surface layer has more than 35 percent, by volume, rock fragments that are mostly less than 3 inches in diameter in an area that has less than 15 percent rock fragments. Typically less than 1 acre.|"260246"
"DC001"|9|"LVS"|"Levee"|An embankment that confines or controls water, especially one built along the banks of a river to prevent overflow onto lowlands.|"260247"
"DC001"|9|"MAR"|"Marsh or swamp"|A water saturated, very poorly drained area that is intermittently or permanently covered by water. Sedges, cattails, and rushes are the dominate vegetation in marshes, and trees or shrubs are the dominant vegetation in swamps. Not used in map units where the named soils are poorly drained or very poorly drained. Typically less than 1 acre.|"260248"
"DC001"|9|"MPI"|"Mine or quarry"|An open excavation from which soil and underlying material have been removed and in which bedrock is exposed. Also denotes surface openings to underground mines. Typically less than 1 acre.|"260249"
"DC001"|9|"ROC"|"Rock outcrop"|An exposure of bedrock at the surface of the earth. Not used where the named soils of the surrounding map unit are shallow overbedrock or where Rock outcrop is a named component of the map unit. Typically less than 1 acre.|"260250"
"DC001"|9|"SLI"|"Slide or slip"|A prominent landform scar or ridge caused by fairly recent mass movement or descent of earthy material resulting from failure of earth or rock under shear stress along one or several surfaces. Typically less than 1 acre.|"260251"
"DC001"|9|"SLP"|"Short, steep slope"|A narrow area of soil having slopes that are at least two slope classes steeper than the slope class of the surrounding map unit.|"260252"
"DC001"|9|"SPO"|"Spoil area"|A pile of earthy materials, either smoothed or uneven, resulting from human activity. Typically less than 1 acre.|"260253"
"DC001"|9|"STV"|"Very stony spot"|A spot where 0.1 to 3.0 percent of the soil surface is covered by rock fragments that are more than 10 inches in diameter in areas where the surface of the surrounding soil is covered by less than 0.01 percent stones. Typically less than 1 acre.|"260254"
"DC001"|9|"WAT"|"Perennial water"|Small, natural or constructed lakes, ponds, or pits that contain water most of the year. Typically less than 1 acre.|"260255"
"DC001"|9|"WET"|"Wet spot"|A somewhat poorly drained to very poorly drained area that is at least two drainage classes wetter than the named soils in the surrounding map unit. Typically less than 1 acre.|"260256"
